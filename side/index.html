									<p><i>I love spending time with my family.</i> 
										<br>I live with my lifelong Danish partner and our two beautiful daughters. I’m also passionate about traveling and diving into new cultures—especially exploring their cuisines! Adventure calls to me, and I’m always up for climbing mountains or finding ways to connect with nature. And when I have some spare time, you might catch me behind the decks as an electronic music DJ, spinning tunes whenever I get the chance.</p>

									<h3>Development path</h3>
									<p>My coding journey began at 17 when I got my first introduction to programming languages and discovered the mystical world of UNIX and LINUX. Back then, I built my very first webpage, wrestling with code while barely understanding what "UI" even meant.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="intro" style="padding-top: 15px;" >
									<p>Around the same time, I dove into hardware—popping open computers, fixing motherboards, swapping out parts, installing Windows, and formatting hard drives like a pro. Those hands-on experiences fueled my love for tech. These early challenges laid the groundwork for my understanding of both the creative and technical sides of digital design. Over time, my passion evolved from tinkering with hardware to crafting user-centered experiences that solve real problems. </p>

												<h3>My carreer journey</h3>
												<p>I started my carreer in the world of web development and SEO, where I built a solid technical foundation, diving into coding, analytics, and search optimization—skills that still guide my work in creating smooth, user-friendly digital products.</p>
												<p>During my last year in design engineering school, I began as a design engineer trainee. This hands-on experience sparked my passion for user-centered design and planted the philosophy that users should always come first.</p>

												<div class="panel"  >
													<div class="span-1-5"  >
														<p>I co-founded a startup with some brilliant minds, and, as the "techie" of the group, took on the role of CTO. I was fully involved in strategy, development, and collaborating across borders, gaining a serious appreciation for entrepreneurship and agile workflows.</p>
														<p>Startup life was seasonal and remote, so I filled my schedule with an engineering student job, where I picked up invaluable insights into production and manufacturing, bridging the gap between design and real-world application.</p>

													<div class="span-1-5"  >
												<p>Through my work as a DJ, I met creative minds in the event industry, which led to freelancing gigs in product and UX design. I wore many hats—from product designer to lighting technician to project management—gaining experience across all stages of product development and mastering agile practices in a truly multidisciplinary setting.</p>
												
													<h2 style="font-family: Impact "><i>Later</i></h2>
												
												<p>Life took a beautiful turn—I became a mom and after maternity leave, I jumped back into UX internships, </p>

													<p>working at two inspiring companies: One an emerging startup, the other firmly established. Not only did I design interfaces, but I also advocated for UX, helping to build solid and user-focused design practices.</p>
													
														<h2 style="font-family: Impact "><i>Now</i></h2>
												
												<p>I’m balancing life with two little ones, sharpening my skills with new courses, and helping companies as a freelance designer. The journey continues, and I’m more excited than ever to see where it leads!</p>
